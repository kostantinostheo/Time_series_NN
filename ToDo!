1. Initialize hashtables for lsh and curves. (init_hashing_lsh)
2. Read input file and save to curves 
3. Snapping
    i.      We hash each curve and we take L gridCurves.
    ii.     We transform each gridCurves to vectors by concatenate each x, y  next to each other.
    iii.    After each vector creation we fill the vector with data to complete its length (if needed)
    iv.     Every vector[L] is hashed with the same g[L]. L =1,2,3,...l
    v.      LSH Booyah!! :(
